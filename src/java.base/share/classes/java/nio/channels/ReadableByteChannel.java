     * Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.
     * <p> 读取 byte 数据到给定的 buffer
     *
     * <p> An attempt is made to read up to <i>r</i> bytes from the channel,
     * where <i>r</i> is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,
     * {@code dst.remaining()}, at the moment this method is invoked.
     * <p> 尝试从 cahnnel 中读取 r byte 的数据，r 是 buffer 中剩余的容量。调用
     * buffer 的 remaining 方法可以返回 r 的值。
     *
     * <p> Suppose that a byte sequence of length <i>n</i> is read, where
     * {@code 0}&nbsp;{@code <=}&nbsp;<i>n</i>&nbsp;{@code <=}&nbsp;<i>r</i>.
     * This byte sequence will be transferred into the buffer so that the first
     * byte in the sequence is at index <i>p</i> and the last byte is at index
     * <i>p</i>&nbsp;{@code +}&nbsp;<i>n</i>&nbsp;{@code -}&nbsp;{@code 1},
     * where <i>p</i> is the buffer's position at the moment this method is
     * invoked.  Upon return the buffer's position will be equal to
     * <i>p</i>&nbsp;{@code +}&nbsp;<i>n</i>; its limit will not have changed.
     *
     * <p> A read operation might not fill the buffer, and in fact it might not
     * read any bytes at all.  Whether or not it does so depends upon the
     * nature and state of the channel.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode,
     * for example, cannot read any more bytes than are immediately available
     * from the socket's input buffer; similarly, a file channel cannot read
     * any more bytes than remain in the file.  It is guaranteed, however, that
     * if a channel is in blocking mode and there is at least one byte
     * remaining in the buffer then this method will block until at least one
     * byte is read.
     *
     * <p> This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has
     * already initiated a read operation upon this channel, however, then an
     * invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
     * complete. </p>

     *          channel has reached end-of-stream

     *
